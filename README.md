In this project I am implementing some of the latest deep learning and machine learning algorithms to help doctors diagnose various fatal diseases with the help of computers and power of deep learning. Complete project report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qOEx4mpFglDD5X2u8HcW9fq6KVdhsO9/view?usp=sharing).

Currently Implemented:

1. [Atrial fibrillation from ecg scan using MIT-bih dataset.](https://github.com/sanchit2843/healthcare.ai/tree/master/ECGclassification)
2. [Detecting Malaria from blood cell microscopic images.](https://github.com/sanchit2843/healthcare.ai/tree/master/malaria)
3. [Pneumonia detection from chestxray images with class activation maps.](https://github.com/sanchit2843/healthcad/blob/master/pneumoniadensenet.ipynb)
